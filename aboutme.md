Atli Gudlaugsson.

I grew up in Breidholt, Reykjavik. Moved to Kopavogur when I was about 15 years old.

Went to Holabrekkuskoli for elementary school, then straight to Menntaskolinn vid Hamrahlid. After a years break, I started studying computer science at Haskolinn i Reykjavik. I am on my third and final year there.

On my first day at HR, I had never seen a single line og code in my life.

High end. I work best in a structured environment far from low level code where I dont have to worry about tedious things. My interest lie most in web programming, both frontend and backend.

I expect to get an insight into how large projects are transitioned from development to deployment, some extra insights on how testing should be done and to further my knowledge and interest in this subject matter.
